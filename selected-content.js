Due Packages target derivation:
1. Start with Maintenance Plan and Maintenance Item from the custom report.
2. Use C_MAINTENANCEITEMDEX_2 to obtain:
   - Task List Type
   - Task List Group
   - Group Counter
3. Use I_MAINTTSKLISTSTRGYPACKAGETP to obtain:
   - Maintenance Package Number
   - Cycle Text
   - Operation Short Text
4. Use Cycle Text / package data as the supported basis for Due Packages.

Current blocker:
- I_MAINTTSKLISTSTRGYPACKAGETP is visible in Customer Data Browser.
- It is not available in Custom CDS Views.
- ADT DDL source access returned HTTP 403 Forbidden.

- provide an equivalent released CDS/API, or
- expose Due Packages directly in I_MaintPlanSchedgOverviewCube.`
